> As robots become more omnipresent in our society, we are facing the challenge of making them more **socially competent**. However, in order to **safely and meaningfully cooperate with humans**, robots must be able to **interact in ways that humans find intuitive and understandable**. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach for **understanding and modelling social behaviour** and implementing social coupling in robots.


> The main objectives of the project are to elaborate and investigate the concept of socSMCs in terms of **information-theoretic and neurocomputational models**, to deploy them in the control of humanoid robots for social entrainment with humans, to elucidate the mechanisms for sustaining and exercising socSMCs in the human brain, to study their breakdown in patients with autism spectrum disorders, and to benchmark the socSMCs approach in several demonstrator scenarios. Our long term vision is to realize a new socially competent robot technology **grounded** in novel insights into mechanisms of functional and dysfunctional social behavior, and to test novel aspects and strategies for **human-robot interaction and cooperation** that can be applied in a multitude of assistive roles relying on highly compact computational solutions.

[Motor cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cognition) 运动认知


> The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is **action**, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific motor goal, or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in **recognizing**, **predicting**, **mimicking** and **understanding the behavior of other people**. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recent years from a variety of research domains including developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and social psychology.
