> As robots become more omnipresent in our society, we are facing the challenge of making them more **socially competent**. However, in order to **safely and meaningfully cooperate with humans**, robots must be able to **interact in ways that humans find intuitive and understandable**. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach for **understanding and modelling social behaviour** and implementing social coupling in robots.


> The main objectives of the project are to elaborate and investigate the concept of socSMCs in terms of **information-theoretic and neurocomputational models**, to deploy them in the control of humanoid robots for social entrainment with humans, to elucidate the mechanisms for sustaining and exercising socSMCs in the human brain, to study their breakdown in patients with autism spectrum disorders, and to benchmark the socSMCs approach in several demonstrator scenarios. Our long term vision is to realize a new socially competent robot technology **grounded** in novel insights into mechanisms of functional and dysfunctional social behavior, and to test novel aspects and strategies for **human-robot interaction and cooperation** that can be applied in a multitude of assistive roles relying on highly compact computational solutions.

> The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is **action**, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific motor goal, or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in **recognizing**, **predicting**, **mimicking** and **understanding the behavior of other people**. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recent years from a variety of research domains including developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and social psychology.

> robot-independent and easily-reconfigurable software framework which allows reusing components to describe a variety of complex manipulation behaviours.


> situation-specific behavior shall be learned by means of a **highly-automated machine learning platform**, which incorporates an interface to a human operator, who via demonstration will show the robot how to deal with unforeseen situations.


> Without requiring any assistance or external tasks from human supervisors, the systems are able to intuitively interact with humans, to support them and learn from them in various situations.

> **This enables a sustained collaboration based on the optimal usage of the cognitive skills of the human being while individually being assisted by autonomous robotic systems.**

> develop new methods that allow autonomous robots to learn self-contained and sustained from their experience, to consolidate the acquired knowledge, and to store this knowledge persistently using appropriate representations. By learning autonomously to **model their current surrounding**, to **adapt their behavior accordingly**, and to **predict the effects of their action**, robots can **act in dynamic environments und are able to continuously adapt to them**. In addition, the systems’ ability to learn complex behaviors based on basic behavior primitives serves to better understand human behavior and to make an interaction significantly more intuitive. Furthermore, **the robot’s behavior can be adapted in such a way that it becomes more predictable for the human, thereby increasing the acceptance of a robotic system as partner in interactions. The predictability of the robot for the human is in turn linked to the predictability of the human for the system, having an important influence on the safety of the human-robot interaction.**


> evaluate the success and the potential consequences of the intended action before execution.


> Since nature itself is the best model for such systems the intended approach is to transfer skills, functional principles, morphologies and control approaches from biological to technical systems.
